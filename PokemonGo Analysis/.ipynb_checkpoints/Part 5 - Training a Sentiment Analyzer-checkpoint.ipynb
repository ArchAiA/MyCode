    "This is the fifth post in an on-going Pokemon Go analysis series.  Last time, we discussed how a Naive Bayes Classifier can be used to predict the class of a sample given a number of features about that sample.  In this post, we'll apply the technique to our Pokemon Go tweets to build a [sentiment analyzer](http://www.nltk.org/book/ch06.html) that automatically classifies whether each tweet has a positive or negative tone.  Once complete, we'll use the sentiment analyzer to remove negative tweets from our data set before using the positive tweets to map out the dominance of each team in each state.  Strap yourselves in &mdash properly tuning a classifier for your data requires careful implementation. This will be the most detailed post of our Pokemon Go series, but the intuition we'll build will be invaluable.  \n",

    "# <a name=\"labeling\"></a> Manually classifying a training set\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from our last post that the implementation of a Naive Bayes Classifier requires a training set of samples which have known features and known classes.  Right now, all of the tweets we've collected are unclassified.  Before we create our sentiment analyzer, we'll have to manually label a subset of the tweets as positive or negative to form our training set.  If you want to avoid manually labeling tweets, you could take an [unsuperivsed machine learning approach](https://marcobonzanini.com/2015/05/17/mining-twitter-data-with-python-part-6-sentiment-analysis-basics/) instead, but these typically have poor performance compared to a supervised approach such as Naive Bayes Classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of manually labeling tweets is going to be time consuming and tedious, but we can use Python to make the process a little more bearable.  First, we'll import the Pandas and JSON libraries."

It's clear this Twitter user has an allegiance to Team Valor, but if we want our sentiment analyzer to recognize that it would need to determine that the first half of the tweet has a negative tone, while the second half of the tweet has a positive tone.  This introduces a lot of complexity to the classifier.  It'd be much simpler to have the analyzer classify the entirity of each tweet as positive or negative, so we should just remove complicated, multi-team tweets from our data set.

    "Before we use the training set to build our sentiment analyzer, we need to consider how to properly handle the data.  Suppose we fed all of our training set to the sentiment analyzer, allowing it to extract whatever features were needed to maximize its prediction accuracy.  In this case, we run the risk of over constraining our sentiment analyzer with obscure features that are only relevant to a handful of tweets.  For instance, maybe one of the tweets that was not included in our training set contains the text \"I really love #TeamValor.  Psych!\"  Without using the fairly uncommon word \"psych\" as a feature, our analyzer would probably classify this tweet as positive.  The only chance we have of correctly identifying the tweet as negative is if the word \"psych\" was also use in one of our training set tweets.  There is no chance that our training set contains every word (inlcuding mispellings and acronyms) that will show up in our entire collection of tweets, so if we evaluate the performance of our classifier based on the tweets it was trained on we will likely overestimate its performance.\n",

This reserved set of data is known as the **test set**, which we will use to evaluate the performance of our sentiment analyzer once it is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "When designing our sentiment analyzer, we'll have a number of choices to make along the way.  How many features should we use?  Should we include the capitalization of words as a feature?  Should we label additional tweets to increase the size of our training set?  These types of choices are known as **hyperparameters** in machine learning, and the answers to each of these questions will effect the performance of our sentiment analyzer.  To improve performance of out sentiment analyzer, we'd like to optimize the hyperparameters we use.  To so do,  we'll need to evaluate the performance of our classifier under different hyperparameter settings &mdash; but which data should we for this evaluation?  We could evaluate the performance using the training set itself, but then we would run into the same risk of over constraining the analyzer that we discussed before.  Instead, we could evaluate the performance of each hyperparameter using the test set that we set aside earlier, but then we would be tuning our classifier to the test set, which defeats the purpose of setting that data aside in the first place.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we'll set another portion of the original training set aside.  This new subset of data is called the **cross validation set**.  We can use it to evaluate the performance of our sentiment analyzer as we tune our hyperparameters.  Since the analyzer is not trained on data from the cross validation set, there is no chance that the performance evaluation will be skewed due to over fitting the data.  Likewise, since analyzer is not trained on data from the test set, and since the the hyperparameters were not tuned with data from the test set, our final evaluation of our analyzer's performance will be a true representation of how it will perform on unlabeled tweets from full entire collection."

Up sampling allows us to see a larger population of the positive tweets, at the cost of giving each feature that we see in the negative tweets more weight.  This typically works best when we have very little data to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we could **down sample** the population of positive tweets in our training set.  This means that each time we put a negative tweet into our training set, we put one positive tweet in as well.  This will result in having far fewer positive tweets in the training sample than up sampling would, but the weight of negative features will be an exact representation of what we see in our population.  This typically works best when we have a large amount of data to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of up sampling, down sampling, or randomly sampling (producing the true positive to negative ratio) is a hyperparameter of our sentiment analyzer.  The easiest way to know which method will work best is to simply try all three and see which gives the best performance on your cross validation set.  In this case, I found that randomly sampling performed horribly, and down sampling performed slightly better than up sampling.  Below, I've included the code I used to put half of the negative tweets into the training set while down sampling positive tweets at a one-to-one ratio.  Half of the remaining tweets were put into my cross validation set, and the final quarter of tweets were put into the test set."

    "We'll define our sentiment analyzer's features with boolean `contains(word)` statements.  For instance, the feature `contains(hate)` will likely be true for a negative tweet, and false for a positive tweet.  We'll need to construct a list of useful words for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our list of words shouldn't include every word we come across in our collection of tweets.  Uncommon words, including acronyms, abbreviations, and mispellings, will cause our sentiment analyzer to overfit the training sample.  We can avoid this issue by requiring that each word appear a certain number of times before we consider it as a feature.  While doing so, we need to consider whether or not to treat words with different capitalizations or punctuations as unqiue.  After testing these hyperparameters with my cross validation set, I found that ignoring capitalization (with the `.lower` string method) and punctuation marks (with the `string.punctuation` set) works best in this case.  Similarly, I found that treating all URLs as identical improved performance on my cross validation set.  Note that in some situations capitalization or punctuation marks may be important context clues, so you'll need to evaluate the hyperparameters on your own cross validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Many words, such as \"an\", are common to both positive and negative tweets.  Including these words as features can actually decrease the performance of our classifier, since they increase the dimensionality of our model without adding additional information.  There are a few ways to deal with such features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Remove the common stop words.  The NLTK library provides a list of common stop words.  You can import it to Python using:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n",
    "stop = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "After importing the list of stop words, it's easy to filter them out with an `if ... not in` statement.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Limit our model to [high-information features](http://streamhacker.com/2010/06/16/text-classification-sentiment-analysis-eliminate-low-information-features/).  These features will contain words which show up far more often in one class than the other.  \n",
    "With this technique we train our model once, and use it to gain information about the most informative features.  We then train our analyzer a second time, using only the most informative features.  The exact number of high information features to use is a hyperparameter which will need to be tuned with the cross validation set.  Using high information features is often a better strategy than simply excluding stop words, since some of the stop words may actually turn out to be important in our context.  This strategy will also help us filter out uncommon words if we neglected to do so beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "I found that my analyzer performed better on my cross validation set when stop words were no excluded as features.  This is likely due to important stop words, such as \"my,\" which help identify which Pokemon Go team the Twitter user is on. I also found that limiting my model to include only high-information features did not significantly change performance, which is likely due to my efforts to optimize the feature extraction process using the other methods discussed in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, consider the following two tweets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"I do like #TeamValor.\"\n",
    "2. \"I do not like #TeamValor.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The content of these tweets are extremely similar.  If we were to train a model that believes the word \"like\" indicates a positive tweet, we would misclassify the second tweet.  It's clear that the classifier's performance would increase if it could recognize that the word \"not\" is negating the word \"like.\"  One way to achieve this is to distinguish every word that follows a negation &mdash; in this case we would end up with  `contains(like)` as a feature for the first tweet, and `contains(like_NEG)` as a feature for the second tweet.  [NLTK's sentiment package](http://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/sentiment/util.html) provides a `mark_negation` function can do this for us:"

    "Another way to address negation markers is to include [bigrams](http://www.nltk.org/howto/collocations.html) in our list of features.  Doing so allows our classifier to recognize the collocation of words such as \"(not,like)\" in addition to the typical unigram features we would extract.  The inclusion of bigrams also allows our classifier to recognize collocations that do not mark negation, such as \"(fuck, team)\", which is far more powerful than tracking the common words \"fuck\" and \"team\" as unigrams alone. (Pardon my French here, but this turned out to be the strongest example of bigrams features from our tweets.)\n",

    "Finally, we want to ensure that our sentiment analyzer performs equally well regardless of which Pokemon Go team the tweet is discussing.  If we were to misclassify every negative tweet about Team Valor as positive, but always correctly classify negative tweets about Team Mystic, then our final population of tweets would contain an overabundance of Team Valor tweets.  This would certainly skew the map of team dominance which we hope to make with our data.

This means we'll be able to elliminate a large portion of the negative tweets from our sample with this classifier.  The positive recall remains high as well, at 78%.  This means that we'll retain a large portion of our sample size once we apply our classifier.  The balance of these two statements is reflected by the fact that our negative contamination metric shows an improvement of 76%.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that our classifier has low negative precision.  While this isn't ideal, it isn't surprising either.  The low negative precision means we are identifying a lot of tweets as negative when they are actually positive.  Given the large class imbalance in our cross valdiation set, it is not surpising that many of the negatively classified tweets are actually positive tweets.  In statistics, this type of \"false positive\" (where here, a \"positive\" result is the tweet being classified as negative) is known as a Type I error.  Although I'd like higher negative precision, a Type I error is okay for our purposes.  As long as the chances of misclassifying a positive tweet are equal for all Pokemon Go teams, a Type I error simply means we are being overly conservative with our classification model. \n",

Unfortunately, the low negative precision means the majority of the \"negative\" tweets we identify will not actually be negative. Therefore, this sentiment analyzer would be unsuited for such an analysis."
