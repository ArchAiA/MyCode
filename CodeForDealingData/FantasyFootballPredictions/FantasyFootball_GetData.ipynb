    "We could try to predict fantasy points, or try to predict stat outcomes themselves.  I think predicting stats has more value, since the result can be adapted to any fantasy scoring method people come up with.   It also has the added benefit of realizing when a particular defense is strong against running, or passing, or both rather than just strong in general.  The downside is that it may be harder to predict individual stats than it would be to predict scores.\n",

First, we need to produce a list of samples, including features and their outcome.  The samples will be stats for an individual player for an individual game.  We'll scan all games played one at a time to collect this information.  What should the features we use for our prediction be?\n",

    "* DONE: Team's average stat against this oppenent (To help account for players switching teams)\n",
    "* DONE: Player's position (QB's don't rush much, for instance.  This is covered by average stat to begin with)\n",
