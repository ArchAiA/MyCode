    "We could try to predict fantasy points, or try to predict stat outcomes themselves.  I think predicting stats has more value, since the result can be adapted to any fantasy scoring method people come up with.   It also has the added benefit of realizing when a particular defense is strong against running, or passing, or both rather than just strong in general.  The downside is that it may be harder to predict individual stats than it would be to predict scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's give predicting stats a shot and see how it works out.  As a first attempt, we should just try to predict something like rushing yards.  First, we need to produce a list of samples, including features and their outcome.  The samples will be stats for an individual player for an individual game.  We'll scan all games played one at a time to collect this information.  What should the features we use for our prediction be?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we can try these features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* DONE: Average relevant stats for the player (From the last X games prior to a game)\n",
    "* DONE: Player's team\n",
    "* DONE: Opponent team\n",
    "* DONE: Team at home or away\n",
    "* DONE: Player's average stat against this oppenent\n",
    "* DONE: Team's average stat against this oppenent (To help account for players switching teams)\n",
    "* DONE: Player's position (QB's don't rush much, for instance.  This is covered by average stat to begin with)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some more stats we might add in the future.  These may be harder to implement but are worth looking into:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Player's injury status\n",
    "* Player's bench status\n",
    "* DONE: (no coach) Player's coach, other players on his team\n",
    "* DONE: (no coach) Oppenent's coach, and other players on opponent team\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's loop through each game and produce our samples for the stats we mentioned in the first list. We'll need to write some functions to calculate the average of the players stats.  **Keep in mind we need to account for unexpected injuries and by weeks... probably just don't include them in the samples at first!**"

It would be better if we asked for the number of weeks to average over, and then queried for all games from that point to our current date.  Instead of returning as aggregate, we would want to loop game by game from the return - creating a list of players for each game, and their corresponding stats.  This would also make it easier to handle players who didn't participate in a game."
