This repository is filled with one-off analyses for my blog, graduate school work, and side projects. Its sole purpose is to store some of my old code in case I need to look up what I've done in the past.  With the exception of the code in `CodeForLUX\Matlab\MyFunctions`, the code was not used by others nor used often, so most of it is poorly commented.  Tread at your own risk =)
